Here‚Äôs a breakdown of each module in the architecture diagram for the Instrumentation Fault Detection Agent (IFDA):

üß† Agents Involved
- 1. Signal Integrity Checker Agent
**Function: Monitors real-time data from field instruments to detect anomalies like signal dropouts, noise, or frozen values.**
**Techniques Used: Statistical thresholds, signal pattern recognition, time-series analysis.**
**Input: JSON stream from PLC/DCS:**
{
"tag": "PT-101",
"value": 45.6,
"status": "OK",
"timestamp": "2025-08-12T10:45:00Z"
}
- 2. Fault Classifier Agent
**Function: Classifies detected anomalies into fault types such as:**
Drift: Gradual deviation from expected range
Spike: Sudden abnormal value
Dropout: Missing or zero signal
**Techniques Used: Machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, SVM), rule-based logic.**
**Input: Cleaned and flagged data from Signal Integrity Checker + calibration logs.**

üîó Dependencies
Real-time Instrument Readings: From PLC/DCS via OPC UA, MQTT, or Modbus.
Calibration Records: Historical calibration data in Excel/CSV format.
Environmental Conditions: Temperature, humidity, vibration data from auxiliary sensors.

üì• Input Format
Live Data: JSON format from control systems.
Historical Logs: Excel/CSV files uploaded periodically or accessed via shared network drives.

üì§ Output Format
Fault Report:
{
"tag": "PT-101",
"fault_type": "Drift",
"confidence": 0.92,
"recommended_action": "Schedule recalibration",
"timestamp": "2025-08-12T10:50:00Z"
}
**Summary Reports: Weekly fault trends, instrument health scores.**

üñ•Ô∏è Presentation Layer
- 1. Fault Dashboard
**Features:**
Drill-down by tag, fault type, zone
Historical trends
Live fault alerts
Technology: Web-based dashboard (e.g., Grafana, Power BI, custom React/Angular app)
- 2. CMMS Integration
**Method:**
REST API or direct database integration with CMMS (e.g., SAP PM, IBM Maximo)
Auto-create work orders based on fault severity
**Example Payload:**
{
"equipment_id": "PT-101",
"fault": "Drift",
"action": "Recalibration",
"priority": "High",
"requested_by": "IFDA",
"timestamp": "2025-08-12T10:50:00Z"
}

## The User Interface



The CSV file should have these columns minimum with title : Time, tag,value
